# 1TriviaPerDay

 ~ Learn a new fun fact or trivia as a notification every time you login. ~

## How it works

When you open 1TriviaPerDay, a notification is sent containing a trivia question and answers (all questions and answers are from the OpenTrivia database API).

To ensure that the app functions properly, **go to System Settings>General>Login Items and Extensions and add 1TriviaPerDay as a login item**. After doing this, a trivia notification will pop up everytime you login.

Also make sure to allow notifications for the 1TriviaPerDay app - **otherwise the app will not function properly**.

## Installation

> Unfortunately, I don't have an Apple Developer account yet, so when it is opened, Apple will show that it is from an unidentified developer.
> 1. Click **OK** to close the popup.
> 2. Open **System Settings**>**Privacy & Security**.
> 3. Scroll down and click **Open Anyway** next to the warning about 1TriviaPerDay.
